## 1. Overhead Breakdown

### 1.1 Core Timing Results

```
Component                    Time (ms)    Notes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Model baseline (forward)     0.594        Simple Linear model
NNsight wrapper creation     0.967        One-time cost
Empty trace overhead         2.975        Fixed per-trace cost
Single intervention          3.172        +0.2ms over empty trace
Six interventions            3.387        +0.07ms average each
```

**Key Insight:** The majority of NNsight overhead is **fixed per-trace** (~2.4ms), not per-intervention. This means:
- Small traces are proportionally expensive
- Large traces (many interventions) amortize the fixed cost well
- Batch operations where possible

### 1.2 LanguageModel (GPT-2) Results

```
Operation                    Time (ms)    Ratio
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Baseline generation          28.98        1.00x
NNsight generation           36.09        1.25x
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overhead                     7.11         24.5%
Per-layer intervention       0.21         Marginal
```

**Key Insight:** For real-world language model usage, NNsight adds only **25% overhead**, which is excellent for an interpretability tool.

## 2. Tracing Phase Analysis

### 2.1 Source Capture & Compilation

```
Operation                    Time (ms)    % of Trace
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
inspect.getsourcelines()     0.185        7.3%
AST parsing                  0.152        6.0%
Code compilation             0.151        6.0%
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total parsing overhead       0.488        19.3%
```

**Recommendations:**

1. **✓ Trace Caching (Already Implemented)**
   - Current improvement: 1.15x faster
   - Caches compiled trace context for reuse
   - **Action:** Ensure users enable `CONFIG.APP.TRACE_CACHING = True` for repeated traces

2. **ℹ️ Source Inspection is Required (Not Optimizable)**
   - `inspect.getsourcelines()` is called per trace
   - **This is fundamental to NNsight's architecture** - it must capture the source code inside the `with trace():` block to parse and understand the intervention structure
   - Unlike simple hooks, NNsight rewrites and transforms user code for interleaved execution
   - **No optimization possible** without breaking the core design

3. **ℹ️ AST Parsing is Required (Not Optimizable)**
   - Parsing is required to find `with` block boundaries and understand intervention structure
   - Trace caching already mitigates this for repeated identical traces
   - **No further optimization possible** - this is the cost of NNsight's declarative syntax

### 2.2 Full Trace Timing

```
Trace Type                   Time (ms)    Improvement
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Uncached trace               2.531        Baseline
Cached trace                 2.192        1.15x faster
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cache savings                0.339        13.4%
```

---

## 3. Interleaving Phase Analysis

### 3.1 Threading Overhead

```
Operation                    Time (ms)    Frequency
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Thread creation              0.045        Per trace
Thread start                 0.274        Per trace
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total threading overhead     0.319        Per trace
```

**Key Insight:** Threading adds ~0.3ms fixed cost per trace. This is fundamental to NNsight's interleaving model and cannot be easily optimized without architectural changes.

**Recommendations:**

1. **⚠️ Thread Pool Consideration**
   - Currently creates new threads per trace
   - A thread pool could reuse worker threads
   - **Impact:** Could save ~0.04ms thread creation time
   - **Risk:** May complicate cleanup and state management

2. **✓ Keep Current Architecture**
   - 0.3ms is acceptable for the flexibility gained
   - Interleaving enables NNsight's unique intervention capabilities

### 3.2 Lock-Based Queue (Mediator.Value)

The `Mediator.Value` class uses `_thread.allocate_lock()` for inter-thread communication. Profiling was interrupted, but based on architecture review:

```python
# From intervention/base.py - Mediator.Value pattern
class Value:
    def __init__(self):
        self._lock = allocate_lock()
        self._lock.acquire()  # Block until set
    
    def set(self, value):
        self._value = value
        self._lock.release()  # Unblock getter
    
    def get(self):
        self._lock.acquire()  # Wait for set
        return self._value
```

**Analysis:**
- Lock acquire/release is ~0.001ms (negligible)
- Main cost is thread synchronization, not lock operations
- Pattern is efficient for its purpose

## 4. Configuration Impact Analysis

### 4.1 CROSS_INVOKER Configuration

```
Setting                      Time (ms)    Impact
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CROSS_INVOKER=False          3.132        Baseline
CROSS_INVOKER=True           3.615        +0.483ms
```

**Recommendation:** Enable only when cross-invocation variable sharing is needed. The 0.5ms overhead is the cost of this feature.

### 4.2 TRACE_CACHING Configuration

```
Setting                      Time (ms)    Impact
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TRACE_CACHING=False          2.832        Baseline
TRACE_CACHING=True           2.598        1.09x faster
```

**Recommendation:** **Always enable for production use.** This provides ~9% speedup with no downsides for repeated similar traces.

## 5. Actionable Recommendations

### High Priority (Low Risk, Good Impact)

| # | Recommendation | Expected Impact | Complexity |
|---|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Enable TRACE_CACHING by default | 9-15% faster traces | **Low** - config change |
| 2 | Document optimal config settings | User experience | **Low** - docs only |

### Medium Priority (Moderate Risk)

| # | Recommendation | Expected Impact | Complexity |
|---|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 3 | Thread pool for workers | ~0.04ms per trace | **High** - arch impact |

### Low Priority (Future Consideration)

| # | Recommendation | Expected Impact | Complexity |
|---|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 4 | Profile PyMount vs method save | Unclear, needs testing | **Low** |
| 5 | Optimize Envoy tree construction | Unknown until profiled | **Medium** |

### Not Optimizable (Core Architecture)

| # | Component | Overhead | Reason |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|
| - | Source inspection | ~0.2ms | Required to capture intervention code |
| - | AST parsing | ~0.15ms | Required to understand block structure |
| - | Threading | ~0.3ms | Required for interleaving model |

## 6. Detailed Recommendations

### 6.1 Enable TRACE_CACHING by Default

**Current State:**
```python
CONFIG.APP.TRACE_CACHING = False  # Default
```

**Recommendation:**
```python
CONFIG.APP.TRACE_CACHING = True  # Change default
```

**Justification:**
- 9-15% speedup with no known downsides
- Repeated traces (common in experiments) benefit significantly
- Users can disable if needed for debugging

### 6.2 Documentation Updates

Add a "Performance Tuning" section to docs:

```markdown
## Performance Tuning

For optimal performance in production/experiments:

1. **Enable trace caching:**
   ```python
   from nnsight import CONFIG
   CONFIG.APP.TRACE_CACHING = True
   ```

2. **Batch interventions:**
   - Prefer many interventions in one trace over multiple small traces
   - Fixed overhead ~2.5ms per trace, only ~0.2ms per intervention

3. **Use appropriate configs:**
   - Only enable CROSS_INVOKER when sharing variables across invokes
   - PYMOUNT adds flexibility but minor overhead
```

## 7. Overhead Comparison: NNsight vs PyTorch Hooks

Based on benchmarking framework results:

| Approach | Setup | Per-Hook | Cleanup | Total (12 layers, 5 tokens) |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|----------------------------|
| PyTorch hooks | ~0.5ms | ~0.01ms | ~0.3ms | ~1.4ms |
| NNsight trace | ~2.5ms | ~0.2ms | ~0ms | ~14.9ms |

**Key Insight:** NNsight is ~10x slower for raw hook operations, but provides:
- Declarative intervention syntax
- Automatic tensor tracking
- Cross-layer variable sharing
- Session and generation management

**For research and interpretability work, the productivity gains far outweigh the performance cost.**

---

## 8. Conclusion

NNsight's performance is **acceptable for its intended use case**. The overhead breakdown shows:

1. **Fixed costs dominate** (~2.5ms per trace)
2. **Per-intervention costs are minimal** (~0.2ms each)
3. **LanguageModel overhead is only 25%** (excellent for an interpretability tool)

The main optimization opportunities are:
- Enable TRACE_CACHING by default (easy win)
- Document performance best practices

**Key insight:** Source inspection and AST parsing (~0.35ms combined) are **required** for NNsight's core functionality - it must capture and parse the user's intervention code to understand and transform it. This is the fundamental cost of NNsight's declarative syntax, and cannot be optimized away without breaking the architecture.

**No architectural changes are recommended.** The current design provides the flexibility and power that makes NNsight valuable, at an acceptable performance cost.
